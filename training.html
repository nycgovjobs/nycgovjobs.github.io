          <p><strong>Hiring new employees is only the start&mdash;it is also essential to train them in the skills that they need to successful in government.</strong>

            <br><br>


          The training structure outlined below is only one option! You may decide to offer more or less training, some of these topics or other topics. 

          <br><br>

          Either way, offering both pre-placement training and ongoing training for all of the participants is an amazing opportunity to prepare them for the workplace and build a cohort mentality, as well as demonstrate your commitment to investing in your staff.

                <h2>Pre-Placement Training</h2><br>

                <p>
                  For your pre-placement training, we recommend a full-time training program that lasts between two and four weeks. Program participants should be hired and onboarded before the start of the training so that they will be paid to attend the training. (This is essential to ensure that the Pipeline is equitable for all participants.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  One option for this pre-placement training is to use a project-based learning approach, with participants working in small teams to complete a real-world project during the course of the program. The teams will need to take a project from concept to proposed pilot and will have an opportunity to "pitch" their project to a panel of government officials at the end of the training.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Participants might learn skills in the morning, then put those skills to work in the afternoon by working on their projects. During the training, participants will have increasing amounts of unstructured time to work on their projects in their teams, as well as to receive coaching and help from the instructors.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A sample project might ask participants to find a solution that helps increase tourism in less-visited parts of the city.

                <h2>Ongoing Training</h2><br>

                <p>
                  For your ongoing training throughout the program, we recommend offering between four to six hours of professional development and social programming per month. This might include workshops, lectures, panels, and tours.
                </p>

                <p>Focus on matching the training with the phases in a new employee's first year:</p>

                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Months 1-3:</strong> Learning</li>
                    <li><strong>Months 4-6:</strong> Persisting</li>
                    <li><strong>Months 7-9:</strong> Growing</li>
                    <li><strong>Months 10-12:</strong> Achieving</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>In the <strong>Learning</strong> phase, focus on skills like organization, written communications, problem analysis, and research. Teach classes on how government works and the history of your city.</p>

                <p>In the <strong>Persisting</strong> phase, focus on skills like resiliency and advocating for yourself, interpersonal communications, and community engagement. Teach classes on government processes and the impact of race, power, and privilege.</p>

                <p>In the <strong>Growing</strong> phase, focus on skills like idea generation, process blueprinting and improvement, managing up, and leading productive dialogues. Teach classes on specific government programs and case studies.</p>

                <p>In the <strong>Achieving</strong> phase, focus on skills like developing pilots, collecting customer feedback, and marketing and storytelling. Teach classes about different career paths in government and the public sector.</p>
