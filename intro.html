            <h2>Does Diversity in Government Matter?</h2><br>

          <div class="row">

              <p>Most public servants are passionate about helping people.</p>

              <p>Should it matter who they are or what they look like?</p>

              <p>Yes!</p>

              <p><strong>Even though a public servant might be amazing at their job does not mean that they can fully understand what it is like to be a part of every community that they serve: they might not be a certain race or low-income or homeless or criminal justice-involved or an immigrant.</strong></p>

              <p>Many recent initiatives have shown that government programs are most effective when designed collaboratively with the communities that the programs are for. These collaboratively designed programs ultimately reflect the true needs of the community, not just what government assumes is needed.</p>

              </div><!-- col -->


              <div class="col-md-7">


              <p>However, public servants <i>themselves</i> also need to be reflective of the communities that they serve in order to ensure that it is not just a few special initiatives that involve the community.</p>

              <p><strong>Hiring people who live in public housing or who receive public benefits to make policy decisions and manage programs will fundamentally improve how government operates, as well as the efficacy of its services.</strong></p>

              <p>So when we talk about diversity in government, what we really mean is President Lincoln's idea of self-government: "...government of the people, by the people, for the people..."</p>

              <p>This is what diversity is all about!</p>

              <div class="col-md-10">

              <p>Local government diversity data usually only shows the diversity of the entire workforce. However, this obscures the fact that most of the employees of color work in frontline, low-paid jobs.</p>

              <p>A better indicator of diversity is to compare the percent of employees of color in executive and senior management roles to the percent of residents of color.</p>

              <p>As you can see, many major cities have a long way to go to achieve true diversity in their government workforces:</p>
